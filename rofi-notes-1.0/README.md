# Simple note taking menu

By default write the notes to `~/Documents/notes` if the directory doesn't exists, it will fail. If you want to change it, check the variable `NOTES_FOLDER` to the folder that you choose.

It converts a non-standard note name to a standard one before creating the empty file with the standard note's name.

## Run it

You can either run `./.run` in the terminal or link the script `.run` to some keyboard shortcut (I am using `Super+N` at the moment -N for notes-).

## Next steps

At the moment it doesn't accept folder navigation nor filter the notes, it would be great to have that funcionality.
